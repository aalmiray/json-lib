= Using Json-lib with Groovy

Since version 2.0 Json-lib has integrated http://groovy.codehaus.org[Groovy]
support, meaning that POGOs can be transformed into JSON and back,
in the same manner as you do now with POJOs. There are other features as well:

* Type transformations with the `as` keyword. +
  A Groovy List (default type is ArrayList) can be transformed into a JSONArray. +
  A Groovy Map (default type is HashMap) can be transformed into a JSONObject. +
  A String can be transformed into JSON, JSONObject, JSONArray and JSONFunction.

[source,groovy]
----
def fromList = [1,true,'json'] as JSONArray
def fromMap = [integer:1, bool: true] as JSONObject
def strAsJson1 = "{integer:1, bool: true}" as JSON
def strAsJson2 = "[1,2,3]" as JSON
def strAsJsonObject = "{integer:1, bool: true}" as JSONObject
def strAsJsonArray = "[1,2,3]" as JSONArray
def strAsFunc = "function(param){ this.param = param; }" as JSONFunction
----

* JSONObject supports the leftShift (&lt;&lt;) operator to append values, the
  following rules apply:
  ** If the shifted arg is a Map, it will call putAll() on the object.
  ** If the shifted arg is a List and its size == 2, the first element will
     be the key, and the second will be the value.
  ** If the shifted arg is a List and its size > 2, the first element will
     be the key, the arg will be shifted by 1 and passed as the value (wi
     ll create a JSONArray because it is a List).
  ** Any other type will be discarded, the object will not be affected nor
     an exception will be thrown.
* JSONObject and JSONArray implement java.util.Comparable, which enables the use of
  the comparison operators with them (including the spaceship operator).
* JSONObject implements java.util.Map and JSONArray implements java.util.List,
  anything you can do with Maps and List can be done with JSONObject and JSONArray.
* JsonGroovyBuilder behaves like the JsonBuilder found in Grails but it will create a
  JSONObject/JSONArray instead of writing the built structure into a String.

WARNING: Since version 2.2.1 Json-lib will not automatically enhance class through
         custom metaclasses, you must call GJson.enhanceClasses() before executing
         the examples shown on this page.
